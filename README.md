A lightweight fan-made launcher for managing and launching Pokémon ROM hacks and fangames that are distributed as standalone `.exe` files.

Many Pokémon fan games and ROM hacks are released as individual Windows executables.  
This launcher provides a clean and convenient way to organize them in one place and launch them from a single interface.
