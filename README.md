# Pokémon Hack Launcher
**Current Version: v0.5.0**


A simple fan-made launcher for managing and starting Pokémon ROM hacks and fan games that are distributed as standalone `.exe` files.

Many Pokémon fan games and ROM hacks are released as individual Windows executables.  
This launcher provides a clean and convenient way to organize them in one place and launch them from a single interface.
